# goyang
YANG parser and compiler to produce Go language objects

### Getting started

To build goyang, ensure you have go language tools installed
(available at [golang.org](golang.org/dl)) and that the `GOPATH`
environment variable is set to your Go workspace.

1. `go get github.com/openconfig/goyang`
    * This will download goyang code and dependencies into the src
subdirectory in your workspace.

2. `cd <workspace>/src/github.com/openconfig/goyang`

3. `go build`

   * This will build the goyang binary and place it in the bin
subdirectory in your workspace.

### Contributing to goyang

goyang is still a work-in-progress and we welcome contributions.  Please see
the `CONTRIBUTING` file for information about how to contribute to the codebase.
